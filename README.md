# RAPaneViewController

Two sliding panes backed by Master and Detail view controllers.

## Sample

Look at the [Sample App](https://github.com/iridia/RAPaneViewController-Sample).  You’ll notice that it slides vertically — which is expected: the sample app contains a tiny subclass of the Sliding Split View Controller that allows you to override the sliding direction pretty easily.

## What’s Inside

You can find an `RAPaneViewController`, and on its interface:

	@property (nonatomic, readwrite, assign) BOOL showingMasterViewController;
	@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) IBOutlet UIViewController *masterViewController;
	@property (nonatomic, readwrite, strong) IBOutlet UIViewController *detailViewController;

That pretty much sums up what it does.  You can set it up with Interface Builder, or with code.

Also, it exposes these methods for toggling things on and off:

	- (void) setShowingMasterViewController:(BOOL)showingMasterViewController animated:(BOOL)animate completion:(void(^)(BOOL didFinish))callback;

	- (void) setMasterViewController:(UIViewController *)toMasterVC animated:(BOOL)animate completion:(void(^)(BOOL didFinish))callback;
	- (void) setDetailViewController:(UIViewController *)toDetailVC animated:(BOOL)animate completion:(void(^)(BOOL didFinish))callback;

So, you can actually do things like this in a sliding table-detail navigation app:

	[wSlidingSplitVC setDetailViewController:toDetailVC animated:YES completion:^(BOOL didFinish) {
		
		[wSlidingSplitVC setShowingMasterViewController:NO animated:YES completion:nil];
			
	}];
